# Pharmacophore Modeling In Drug Discovery
Authors (@slack): Sara Samer (@Sarasamer22)
 
The concept of pharmacophore was first introduced in 1909 by Paul Ehrlich, who defined the pharmacophore as ‘a molecular framework that carries (phoros) the essential features responsible for a drug’s (pharmacon) biological activity <sup>(1)</sup>. Pharmacophore modeling plays an important role in drug discovery, as it accelerates the design and the optimization of new pharmaceutical compounds by the identification of the structural and chemical features of a chemical compound and the interactions formed between the drug and the target. This assay will demonstrate the important approaches of pharmacophore modeling and it's applications.

**Approaches of pharmacophore modeling**

There are two important approaches in pharmacophore modeling that are used in the design and optimization of drugs, which are structure-based pharmacophore modeling and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling <sup>(2)</sup>.<sup> </sup>

**Structure-based pharmacophore modeling** is used when the structure of the target protein is available. It involves the generation of three-dimensional pharmacophore model of a protein structure or a receptor, and it's important for the analysis of the complementary chemical features of the active site and the interactions formed with the ligand to determine the essential features and their spatial arrangements, and it can be classified into two subcategories which are: macromolecule–ligand-complex based and macromolecule (without ligand)-based <sup>(3)</sup>. Macromolecule-based has an advantage over macromolecule-ligand-complex based because macromolecule–ligand-complex requires 3d modeling which can't be applied when the ligands are unknown <sup>(4)</sup>. One of the most common programs used is Discovery Studio.

**Ligand-based pharmacophore modeling is** used when a set of ligands are available and the structure of the protein or the binding site is unknown. It's commonly carried out by analyzing the three-dimensional structures of the known ligands. It is used in gathering ligands with highest affinity, the generation of conformations with the lowest energy and molecular superimposition of ligands to obtain a common 3d pharmacophore and it's used in database screening to discover new active ligands. The most commonly used programs: LigandScout and Discovery studio <sup>(5)</sup>.

 
**Applications of Pharmacophore Modeling:**

The most common applications in pharmacophore modeling are: virtual screening, predicting pharmacokinetic properties as ADMET, target identification and De Novo ligand design with pharmacophores.
 
**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, pharmacophore modeling plays an important role in drug discovery and lead optimization and it's considered to be a continuous advancing computational tool that will lead to further development in discovering new drugs for wide range of diseases in the future.
